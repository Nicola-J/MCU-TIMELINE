# Marvel Movie Timeline Website

## Overview
This project is a simple website that helps new Marvel fans watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies in the correct timeline order. Each movie is represented as an interactive banner, and clicking on a movie takes the user to a dedicated page with its trailer, release date, and cast information.

- Each movie banner is interactive and opens a separate page.

  - Movie trailers (embedded from YouTube).
  - Cast list.
  - "Back to Home" button for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
